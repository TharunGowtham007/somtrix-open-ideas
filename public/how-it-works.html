      <h1>How the SomTriX ideas board works</h1>
      <p>
        This page explains how the public ideas board is used inside SomTriX.
        It is not a legal contract, just a clear explanation of the flow.
      </p>

      <div class="pill-row">
        <span class="pill">Public</span>
        <span class="pill">Idea level</span>
        <span class="pill">Community votes</span>
      </div>

      <h2>1. What you can do here</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Share a real problem you see in the world, your city, college or domain.</li>
        <li>Hint a high-level direction for how it could be solved.</li>
        <li>Browse ideas from others.</li>
        <li>Support ideas you would personally love SomTriX to explore.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. What SomTriX does with these ideas</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We regularly review the board and look for repeating patterns in problems.</li>
        <li>Ideas with strong support (votes) are marked as “high-interest directions”.</li>
        <li>
          From those, we may pick a small number for explorations like:
          concept notes, quick prototypes, or limited pilots.
        </li>
        <li>
          When we move forward with any direction, we may communicate it via our official channels
          (website / socials / direct contact where appropriate).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. What you should <strong>not</strong> post here</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Detailed code, algorithms, or technical tricks that you consider secret.</li>
        <li>Exact business models, pricing details, or partner lists that are confidential.</li>
        <li>Anything you might want to patent privately or protect legally in the future.</li>
        <li>Personal data about someone who has not clearly agreed to be mentioned.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Ownership and public nature</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Everything you post here is text on a <strong>public board</strong>. Anyone with the link
          can read it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not treat this as an NDA space or a private invention submission portal. It is purely
          for open, high-level idea discovery.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have a confidential invention to discuss, that should be done using a different,
          formal process – not through this public site.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. How voting works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The “Support” button is a simple public vote, not a guarantee that we will build it.</li>
        <li>More supports = stronger signal of community interest.</li>
        <li>
          We combine votes with our own feasibility checks, timing, and strategy before making any
          decision.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. If you want to reference this page</h2>
      <p>
        You can share this URL with your friends or teammates when you ask them to submit or
        support ideas. It explains exactly what the board is and is not.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        If you are ever unsure whether something is safe to post here, it’s safer to keep it
        private and only share a simpler, high-level version of the idea.
